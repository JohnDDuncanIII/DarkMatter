Now you can use Espy Sans on your printer and on-screen. Back in 1995, I decided to take on the challenge of making scalable fonts out of bitmap fonts. I also decided to extend the Nu Sans family past what Espy Sans offered; I added an italic and bold italic to my Nu Sans family. I have many users who swear by Nu Sans as the default font for their web browsers. :-)|*||*|I've recently incorporated advanced hand-edited TrueType instructions to improve the on-screen appearance of Nu Sans at any point size - without bitmap fonts. The regular and bold weights are fully hinted. The other styles of Nu Sans will get the same treatment in future versions.
